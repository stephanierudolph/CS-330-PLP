For this Programming Language Project, I will going through the basics of the programming language Swift.

## History
Swift is an open-source programming language, first released in 2014. Its development was led by Chris Lattner at the company Apple. The language was designed to be used for Apple software development, however, it is also compatible with other operating systems. Swift was designed to replace Objective-C, which was an older programming language that Apple was using at the time. Swift was built to be easier, faster, and more resistant to errors. Swift is primarily used to develop applications within the apple ecosystem, however Swit can be used to write programs for other purposes such as command line tools, web services,  and cross-platform libraries for code.  For this project, I plan on using various articles and video tutorials as resources. Fortunately, Swift, as well as the Apple Developer website both have countless articles on the subject.

## Getting Started
### Installation 
In order to get swift running, I downloaded [Xcode](https://itunes.apple.com/app/xcode/id497799835) from the app store on MacOS. I recommend that Mac users use Xcode. Xcode is the easiest to set up and does not require any additional downloads. For Windows users, Xcode is not available, so I recommend using another programming environment such as VScode and downloading the appropriate developer package from the [Swift website](https://www.swift.org/install/windows/#installation-via-windows-package-manager). 

### Running a Program
To run a program in Swift on Xcode, you can view a preview from the canvas. Alternatively, you can run it by using command R or clicking the play button on the top left of the page. This will open up a simulation of a device running the application. 

### Comments
To make comments, you can use // for single line comments and /* */ for multi-line comments.

```
// single line comment
/* multi-line
comment */
```
